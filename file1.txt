Geography[edit]
Eibar lies at an altitude of 121m above sea level, in the west of the province of Gipuzkoa, right next to Biscay.[1] Eibar has an oceanic climate. The town lies in a narrow valley in a mountainous area, the highest mountains are between 700 and 800 metres high. Eibar is traversed by river Ego, which is a tributary of the Deba.[2]

Apart from the urban area, the municipality consists of five rural neighbourhoods: Otaola-Kinarraga, Aginaga, Arrate, Mandiola and Gorosta.[3]

History[edit]
The city was chartered by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1346, receiving the name of Villanueva de San Andrés de Heybar.[4][5]

The feudal families that dominated the territory engaged in the War of the Bands. Eibar, like the rest of settlements in the valley, had an industry based on finery forges and the manufacture of arms. In 1766, Eibar got engaged in a social revolt known as the Machinada, and years later, in 1794, it was attacked by the French, who destroyed the town.[4]

In the 19th century, industrialisation transformed the production systems in the city and was accompanied by an important social movement. In the Carlist Wars, Eibar sided with the Liberals. Labour movement and socialism became particularly strong in Eibar. In 1931, Eibar was the first city in Spain to proclaim the Second Spanish Republic; in recognition it was given the title of "Very Exemplary City".[4][6]

In the Spanish Civil War, Eibar was practically destroyed. The rebuilding brought an important industrial development and a demographic increase, as Eibar reached nearly 40,000 inhabitants in a few years.[4][7]

Due to the lack of space for enlargements, several factories moved to Durangaldea and Álava.[8] The industrial crisis in the 1980s also made Eibar lose a great part of its population.[4]

In the beginning of the 21st century, Eibar's economy is based on industry and services.[4]
